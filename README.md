# Student Score Predictor - Aradhya Shukla üßëüèª‚Äçüéìüåü

### Introduction About the Data :

#### Dataset: Students Performance in Exams - https://www.kaggle.com/code/aryanml007/students-performance-analysis/input

## Description

This dataset contains information about student performance on exams, including:

- `gender`: Gender of the student (male/female)
- `ethnicity`: Ethnicity of the student
- `parental_level_of_education`: Highest education level of the student's parents
- `lunch`: Type of lunch the student has (standard or free/reduced)
- `test_preparation_course`: Whether the student completed a test preparation course (completed or none)
- `math_score`: Score obtained in the math exam
- `reading_score`: Score obtained in the reading exam
- `writing_score`: Score obtained in the writing exam

**Size:** The dataset consists of approximately 1000 rows (students) and 8 columns (features).

## Possible Uses

- Analyze factors influencing student performance
- Identify areas for improvement in educational programs
- Predict student performance based on various factors

## Target Variable

- `math_score`: Score obtained in the math exam

# Approach for the project 

1. Data Ingestion : 
    * In Data Ingestion phase the data is first read as csv. 
    * Then the data is split into training and testing and saved as csv file.

2. Data Transformation : 
    * In this phase a ColumnTransformer Pipeline is created.
    * for Numeric Variables first SimpleImputer is applied with strategy median , then Standard Scaling is performed on numeric data.
    * for Categorical Variables SimpleImputer is applied with most frequent strategy, then ordinal encoding performed , after this data is scaled with Standard Scaler.
    * This preprocessor is saved as pickle file.

3. Model Training : 
    * In this phase base model is tested . The best model found was catboost regressor.
    * After this hyperparameter tuning is performed on catboost and knn model.
    * A final VotingRegressor is created which will combine prediction of catboost, xgboost and knn models.
    * This model is saved as pickle file.

4. Prediction Pipeline : 
    * This pipeline converts given data into dataframe and has various functions to load pickle files and predict the final results in python.

5. Flask App creation : 
    * Flask app is created with User Interface to predict the gemstone prices inside a Web Application.
